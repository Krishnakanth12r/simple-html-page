            <p><b style="margin-left: 50px; cursor:zoom-out; color: aqua;">Srinivasa Ramanujan</b> was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India.Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.
             Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: according to<b style="color: aqua;"> Hans Eysenck</b>: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work,</u> but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways they could not be bothered".
           
             <p><span style="margin-left: 50px;"></span>Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge.
             In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that <u style="font-family: cursive;"> "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",</u> and some recently proven but highly advanced result</p>
             
             <p><span style="margin-left: 50px;"></span>In 1919, ill health—now believed to have been hepatic amoebiasis (a complication from episodes of dysentery many years previously)—compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32. His last letters to Hardy, written in January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new mathematical ideas and theorems. His "lost notebook", containing discoveries from the last year of his life, caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered in 1976. 
             A deeply religious Hindu, Ramanujan credited his substantial mathematical capacities to divinity, and said the mathematical knowledge he displayed was revealed to him by his family goddess Namagiri Thayar. He once said, "An equation for me has no meaning unless.</p>
